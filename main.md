## Document introduction

Email is considered as a medium that provides maximum reach for minimal investment and has served as an essential element of many marketing campaigns across all industries. Especially now, when more people than ever are getting access to internet. As developers we want the email clients to be easy and comfortable to use, but how do we do that?

### Solution

By using ethnomethodology and field work to observe paper mail handling workflow at home to get the insight of human behaviour in dealing with mail. Paper mail can differ from home to home, so we will be observing behaviours to determine, what functionality does our email client require. We will also be using the data collected by Richard Harper and his book "Inside the Smart Home"

## Informal requirements report

First we study the common way of handling mail at home in sequential order:

* Mail arrives at a delivery point

> Our client needs to have an entry point which the emails will be sent to. Always has to be one and all users should have access to it.

* Mail is collected and placed to a shared space

> Our client needs a shared space which users have access to and can sort the mail that was directed to the house or to a specific user. Also directed mail can not be open by anyone else than the specified receiver.

* Mail is sorted and spam is gotten rid of

> Our client should be able to show visual queues for emails, so that obvious spam letter can be gotten rid of and mail can be sorted into relative groups based on importance. Users should also be able to assign letters to other users.

* Mail is viewed by the receiver in private

> Our client should allow for separate user accounts which have unique identifications for storing emails, so that privacy is maintained.

---

* Mail that does not require immediate action is placed somewhere where it can be dealt with later on

> Our client needs to be able to make reminders about mail and allow users to set dates when to be reminded of the mail

* Mail that does not require to be dealt with is put away

> Our client should allow users to move email into long term storage, where it would not interfere with new incoming email

* Mail that is unique (birthday, holiday, thank you cards etc. )

> Our client should allow users to create email storage groups for separating email.
