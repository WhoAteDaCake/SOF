# Introduction

As our product is mainly web based, we choose the <b>Client-server<b> architecture.
We will seperate each of our components into self contained services because:

* It's easier to modify and update each service, without other breaking.
* Services can be moved to cloud to allow:
  * Wider access range (not just from inside the home)
  * Easier service management
  * Cost reduction by only turning on services when needed
